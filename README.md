# reverso-context-with-blanks
 Anki add-on for getting sentences from reverso. Download it into your anki from here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/680321806

When adding new cards, you will get an option to automatically fetch a fixed number of sample sentences from the Reverso website (<a href="https://context.reverso.net/" rel="nofollow">https://context.reverso.net/</a>). When adding a card, choose the "Cloze reverso" note type which will be created by the add-on. Enter a word in the "Word" field, and then click anywhere else (stop the mouse focus on this field), for example, click on the "Context" field. The sentences fetched from Reverso will automatically appear in the "Context" field.

The "Cloze reverso" note type has a custom template defined. Thanks to this template, when studying a card, you will always be presented with a cloze task made out of a random sentence. You will also see a button "Check native language" to see a translation of the sentence.

At the bottom of the "add card" window, you can adjust the language which you are learning and your native language.

You can adjust the number of sentences fetched from Reverso and the languages icons shown in the list of languages in the add-on's config. The config can be accessed from the add-on window which appears when you press on Tools-&gt;Add-ons

This is my first add-on. I hope it will help you learning languages by providing you with more versatile tasks than usual anki cards. Please, report any problems you encounter with the add-on by creating an issue at this repository.
